# My Dotfiles

This is a simple dotfile for my basic setup

## Dependencies

If using MacOS, homebrew is a good thing to have, the script tries to install dependencies automatically
(for Arch, yay is installed for AUR packages)

- zsh
- starship (prompt)
- znap (plugin manager)
  
Optional:
- yay (who doesn't like yogurt?)
- ssh-keygen (openssh)
- xclip (I like pbcopy and pbpaste ðŸ˜‚)
- some nerd-font
- fzf (fuzzy search change lives)

## Setting Up

```shell
git clone https://github.com/luancm/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
source ~/.dotfiles/install
```
